MEANING OF THE TERM "Work"
==========================

In the case of the EMISA Bundle, the "Work" is the collection of the 
following 7 files:

README.md     --  start by reading this file
manifest.txt  --  the file you are reading now
emisa.dtx     --  main source file
emisa.ins     --  installation script
bitmap.jpg    --  graphic file used for the documentation
figure.pdf    --  graphic file used for the documentation
vector.pdf    --  graphic file used for the documentation

If you have received the 7 files listed above, you possess an integral copy 
of the EMISA Bundle.



MEANING OF THE TERM "Compiled Work"
===================================

In the case of the EMISA Bundle, a "Compiled Work" is the collection of:

a) the following 2 files that are also part of the "Work" (see above):

README.md
manifest.txt


AND
b) the following 6 files:

emisa.cls                 --  LaTeX document class
emisa.bbx                 --  biblatex bibliography style
emisa.cbx                 --  biblatex citation style
emisa.pdf                 --  class documentation
emisa-author-template.tex --  template for authors
emisa-issue-template.tex  --  template for editors

The file `emisa.pdf' is obtained by submitting to the 
program pdflatex the file `emisa.dtx', following the same steps as 
those explained in `README.md' under the title "How to generate the 
documentation".



COMMENT
=======

Please remember that, in order to distribute a LPPL-compliant copy of the 
EMISA Bundle, it suffices to distribute only the 7 files that constitute 
the "Work".
